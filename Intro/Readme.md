# What is OOP?

In casual term, OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to design software. It is a way of programming that uses objects and classes to represent real-world entities and their relationships. 

In technical term, OOP is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

Example in Real Life:

Let's say car is an object. It has attributes like color, model, and methods like start(), stop(), and accelerate().

Another Example:

Let's say person is an object. It has attributes like name, age, and methods like eat(), sleep(), and walk().

So, in the conclusion we need oop to structure our code in a way that it is easy to understand and maintain.
